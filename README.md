# Air Pollution Classification

**Air Pollution Classifier - Deep Learning Project**

---

**Project Overview**

This deep learning project aims to build a robust air quality classifier from photos using two different deep learning architectures. The first model utilizes the Functional API with MobileNet as the feature extractor, combined with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for classification. The second model is based on a Sequential API with VGG16, applying transfer learning for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) modeling.

Additionally, a Flask-based web application has been developed to allow users to classify air quality from photos using the VGG16 model.
